GStreamer 1.22 has not been released yet. It is scheduled for release
around the end of December 2022.

1.21.x is the unstable development version that is being developed in
the git master branch and which will eventually result in 1.22, and
1.21.2 is the current development release in that series

It is expected that feature freeze will be around 18 November 2022,
followed by several 1.21 pre-releases and the new 1.22 stable release
around the end of December 2022.

1.22 will be backwards-compatible to the stable 1.20, 1.18, 1.16, 1.14,
1.12, 1.10, 1.8, 1.6,, 1.4, 1.2 and 1.0 release series.

GStreamer Rust Bindings and Rust Plugins

The GStreamer Rust bindings are released separately with a different
release cadence that’s tied to gtk-rs, but the latest release has
already been updated for the upcoming new GStreamer 1.22 API.

gst-plugins-rs, the module containing GStreamer plugins written in Rust,
has also seen lots of activity with many new elements and plugins.

What follows is a list of elements and plugins available in
gst-plugins-rs, so people don’t miss out on all those potentially useful
elements that have no C equivalent.

-   FIXME: add new elements

Rust audio plugins

-   audiornnoise: New element for audio denoising which implements the
    noise removal algorithm of the Xiph RNNoise library, in Rust
-   rsaudioecho: Port of the audioecho element from gst-plugins-good
    rsaudioloudnorm: Live audio loudness normalization element based on
    the FFmpeg af_loudnorm filter
-   claxondec: FLAC lossless audio codec decoder element based on the
    pure-Rust claxon implementation
-   csoundfilter: Audio filter that can use any filter defined via the
    Csound audio programming language
-   lewtondec: Vorbis audio decoder element based on the pure-Rust
    lewton implementation

Rust video plugins

-   cdgdec/cdgparse: Decoder and parser for the CD+G video codec based
    on a pure-Rust CD+G implementation, used for example by karaoke CDs
-   cea608overlay: CEA-608 Closed Captions overlay element
-   cea608tott: CEA-608 Closed Captions to timed-text (e.g. VTT or SRT
    subtitles) converter
-   tttocea608: CEA-608 Closed Captions from timed-text converter
-   mccenc/mccparse: MacCaption Closed Caption format encoder and parser
-   sccenc/sccparse: Scenarist Closed Caption format encoder and parser
-   dav1dec: AV1 video decoder based on the dav1d decoder implementation
    by the VLC project
-   rav1enc: AV1 video encoder based on the fast and pure-Rust rav1e
    encoder implementation
-   rsflvdemux: Alternative to the flvdemux FLV demuxer element from
    gst-plugins-good, not feature-equivalent yet
-   rsgifenc/rspngenc: GIF/PNG encoder elements based on the pure-Rust
    implementations by the image-rs project

Rust text plugins

-   textwrap: Element for line-wrapping timed text (e.g. subtitles) for
    better screen-fitting, including hyphenation support for some
    languages

Rust network plugins

-   reqwesthttpsrc: HTTP(S) source element based on the Rust
    reqwest/hyper HTTP implementations and almost feature-equivalent
    with the main GStreamer HTTP source souphttpsrc
-   s3src/s3sink: Source/sink element for the Amazon S3 cloud storage
-   awstranscriber: Live audio to timed text transcription element using
    the Amazon AWS Transcribe API

Generic Rust plugins

-   sodiumencrypter/sodiumdecrypter: Encryption/decryption element based
    on libsodium/NaCl
-   togglerecord: Recording element that allows to pause/resume
    recordings easily and considers keyframe boundaries
-   fallbackswitch/fallbacksrc: Elements for handling potentially
    failing (network) sources, restarting them on errors/timeout and
    showing a fallback stream instead
-   threadshare: Set of elements that provide alternatives for various
    existing GStreamer elements but allow to share the streaming threads
    between each other to reduce the number of threads
-   rsfilesrc/rsfilesink: File source/sink elements as replacements for
    the existing filesrc/filesink elements

    -   FIXME

-   GStreamer may fail to build the hotdoc documentation with the Meson
    0.64.0 release owing to a Meson bug. This should only affect systems
    where hotdoc is installed, and will be fixed in Meson 0.64.1 by
    Meson PR 10982 in combination with GStreamer MR 3352. In the
    meantime, users can pass -Ddoc=disabled or downgrade to an older
    Meson version (< 0.64.0).

Stable 1.22 branch

After the 1.22.0 release there will be several 1.22.x bug-fix releases
which will contain bug fixes which have been deemed suitable for a
stable branch, but no new features or intrusive changes will be added to
a bug-fix release usually. The 1.22.x bug-fix releases will be made from
the git 1.22 branch, which will be a stable branch.

1.22.0

1.22.0 is scheduled to be released around December 2022.

Schedule for 1.24

Our next major feature release will be 1.24, and 1.23 will be the
unstable development version leading up to the stable 1.24 release. The
development of 1.23/1.24 will happen in the git main branch of the
GStreamer mono repository.

The plan for the 1.24 development cycle is yet to be confirmed.

1.24 will be backwards-compatible to the stable 1.22, 1.20, 1.18, 1.16,
1.14, 1.12, 1.10, 1.8, 1.6, 1.4, 1.2 and 1.0 release series.
